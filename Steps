the steps are:

1-make sure are using the same version of en in all the files
we extracts the sentences only
we then prepare the translation english_Sent ||| translated_one

2-we add the translations to a system to translations folder

3-we run evaluate_All after specifying the language and the folder of translation to use

in french: est-ce, E-T-ELLE,  t-shirt...this makes morphology problem
make sure that tokenization is fine for both
make sure that spacy module is loaded correctly
